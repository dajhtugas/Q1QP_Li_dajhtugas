            <p>In these sets of data, we see that <strong>Asia</strong> has the most number of countries <br> within the TOP 50 most depressed countries. <br>
            We also see that countries in the lower-middle income level <br> have the majority of the TOP 50 countries. <br>However, the countries with <strong>HIGH</strong>  
            income level experience depression more <br>than other countries with lower income.</p>

            <p>In this data, we can see that most countries in the TOP 50 have a Happiness Index Rating of around 101.5. <br>The standard deviation is 37.9,
            which means that there is a large difference in the ranking from the highest and lowest. </p>

            <p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> <br>
            
            With the data we have obtained and gathered, we can conclude that Asia is a region where we can find countries with a high prevalance of depression. <br>
            Most of the countries that were found in the top 50 came from the Afro-Eurasian Region. <br> Surprisingly, countries with a high income level have the highest depression prevalence.
            Factors of these may include: pressure from legacy <br> and being the breadwinner of the family. </p>
